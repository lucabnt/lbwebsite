I created a collection of 36 photos that, I think, best represent my experience in Tübingen. Those pictures cover a period from October 2021 to September 2022 and were taken in Tübingen and in the surrounding are, with just few exceptions from some other attractive German cities.
The collection is entitled "[One year in Tü. A chapter.]()" and it is fully available on [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.uno/@bonte.lu).

Here you can view every photo with a little bit of commentary!

### 1/

This is one of my favourite glimpse on [Marktplatz](https://goo.gl/maps/PpMhPWYci6sE9V2j8).

### 2/

The [Stocherkahnrennen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocherkahnrennen) is probably one of the highlights of the summer semester in Tübingen. It is held (almost) every year since 1956 and the date to save is the Corpus Christi day (on a Thursday, usually in June).

A view of the [Stiftskirche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Collegiate_Church,_T%C3%BCbingen) from the [Schloss Hohentübingen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Hohent%C3%BCbingen) (more precisely from [here](https://goo.gl/maps/9v5HuyWJZe7vWZuTA)).

### 4/

When I firstly arrived in Tübingen, in October 2021, Germany was close to the biggest change of the last years. [Angela Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) retired and Germany started to be a little bit more confused.

### 5/

This [elevetor](https://goo.gl/maps/unKfgHvBdCHU5R2h8) (at least twice as old as me) was literally the first thing I saw in Tübingen.

### 6/

[WHO](https://goo.gl/maps/M7d5BacQRDadTQse7) and its "iconic" buildings. I feel like I spent too much time there.
