During my stay in Tübingen (Germany), hiking was one of my favourite activities and I have to admitt the surrounding area was perfect for it.

Therefore, I created a collection of all the hikes I did and I also selected some of the best ones, which will be immediately presented as Top Hikes. 

Each hike will be presented through the [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4403103), which often also include some pictures and I'll also include a link to the [Komoot activity](https://www.komoot.it/user/2218098976141), since it allows you to download the GPX file, which can be used to replicate the hike.

This blog post is part of a Tübingen themed project made of three posts, so you may also want to visit the Tübingen Experiential Guide for International Students (coming soon!) and the [Tübingen Photo Collection](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/).

Enjoy!

### Top Hike: around Burg Hohenzollern

This hike takes you, from the Bisingen train station, up to the [Burg Hohenzollern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenzollern_Castle) (which you can visit), then up to the Zoller Horn hill (from where you can have [an amazing view](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/#20) of the castle) and back to Bisingen. 

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/786302697?share_token=aIEibxQFqoDbQcsaw74Wk6kw6OTKPCOEekPQjOA2OI0RasYQUl&ref=wtd "Komoot").

### Top Hike: Schwarzwald Genießerpfad from Calw

This is probably the easiest way to have a little taste of the Black Forest, starting in the nice town of [Calw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calw) and following a loop tour that includes the [city scaffold](https://www.komoot.it/highlight/78321), where death sentences were carried out until the beginning of the 19th century, and some other cute passages. 

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/907533563?share_token=aPZ37hKQhJb93wUI5GwuX1py3qfST4PmbrLfjE3LZWS54tnTxS&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7719807992" >}}

### Top Hike: around Teckberg

This hike was surprisingly good. Firstly, you go up to Teckberg, where there is a little [Burg](https://goo.gl/maps/AtUbzGXJYD7HTh2a8), then you visit some [ruins](https://goo.gl/maps/PtLoEGiH7LZYQbby9) and finally an elevated walkway over a [piece of land full of snakes and frogs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schopflocher_Torfmoor). [This picture](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/#19) was taken close to that site.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/770772712?share_token=abQV14KuwJkTJnx6YCgSLVCpP3pyuaB3d6GEk7riH8aQcMxaYx&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7147305430" >}}

### Top Hike: around Bad Urach

[Bad Urach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Urach) is one of the best hiking destinations. There you will be amazed by the [waterfalls](https://goo.gl/maps/5CR8cAZo2D9mj3pB8) and you will visit the [Hohenurach ruins](https://goo.gl/maps/5QQ8h8QjRiFmhpoe6). 

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/778869387?share_token=as67jEU9G7Pu2XXJMvR5IR45X3MgjpyD9W2T4ZvW6rVJZN4Uqh&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7185607917" >}}

### along the Danube to Sigmaringen

If you have ever seen the Danube in Budapest, you'll be easily surprised by how small it is in Sigmaringen. This hike will lead you along the newborn river, crossing the [Teufelsbrücke](https://www.komoot.it/highlight/438257) (Devil's Bridge) and ending in Sigmaringen. A good opportunity to visit the [Sigmaringen Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmaringen_Castle).

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/972365219?share_token=atqZyk43Pkk8zNIdwKLHhNrZ5qQOUOQS1G4nS1u0mt4Wm0J7OC&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="6292836932" >}}

### from Tübingen WHO to Wurmlinger Kapelle, and back

The [Wurmlinger Kapelle](https://goo.gl/maps/T2LqqEmh85zj7ZxZ7) is located at the opposite end of the Tübingen Schlossberg. The hill is quite nice, with a good view on the nearby plains.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/902468157?share_token=aG2vCmTupWW8blCowwXp1QXf57SG1KzHHs0WWoLrOUvu0WS7zW&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7698801655" >}}

### from Balingen to Zillhausen (almost) waterfall

This hike takes you from Balingen you to the Zillhausen waterfall, which, unfortunately, were dry when I went there. I guess, it is way nicer when there actually is a waterfall.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/902468157?share_token=aG2vCmTupWW8blCowwXp1QXf57SG1KzHHs0WWoLrOUvu0WS7zW&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="6819369738" >}}

### from Tübingen to Schönbuchturm, and back

This was probably the craziest one. A 7 round trip crossing the whole [Schönbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbuch) twice. On the way over I took the path with a panoramic view of the nearby towns, while I got back taking a more internal one.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/972362976?share_token=aVDC7dshJBD5WSU1eCQJ0CZt9DHrSnFWXoGR96kWUskpfn168w&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7292323295" >}}

### from Tübingen to Herrenberg

An easier solution to visit the [Schönbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbuch) park is leaving from Tübingen and finishing in Herrenberg. [Herrenberg](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/#22) is a cute small town and close to it there is the [Schönbuchturm](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/#21), a panoramica tower with a view on the whole forest.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/755603142?share_token=aHgqiefs3ylGcpKI3hBSjMKP8oIGkuJn9N1WgCCLVyYt8J7LLi&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7070979253" >}}

### from Tübingen to Dettenhausen via Bromberg

Also this hike crosses the [Schönbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbuch) park, but, instead of going west, as in the previous ones, it goes north, ending up in Dettenhausen, with also some up and downs on the near hills.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/762834783?share_token=a1tkPzX1ziCrOpfzZdJoUmrNM83nzbEmCRZdBmU4Vzxriw27U9&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7108715590" >}}

### around Rottenburg am Neckar

[Rottenburg am Neckar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottenburg_am_Neckar) is another nice and small town close to Tübingen and this hike takes you around the surrounding areas.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/685497302?share_token=ae5wEpNaIJzP8g5zslwe8Zcqxa0sPTgzQiQWUGF0iAAEG6w61L&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="6746313430" >}}

### around Schönbuch

This hike explores the really nice Schönbuch wooded area around [Bebenhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebenhausen) (a village in Tübingen district), with a good opportunity to spot some wild animals.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/678294933?share_token=aIUWLJOkWffcj6ef11uJ7jrQt2L2cwCDFsqCHvGohSyVF12X9I&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="6712135738" >}}

### around Hagelloch to Bebenhausen

Before arriving in Bebenhausen again, this hike crosses the area surrounding [Hagelloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagelloch), another village in Tübingen district.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/929681393?share_token=aU0Z1uvkubbqJIsOYI2dt1BbvB4YRuav4FtJqAprjBHsr2DgSH&ref=wtd "Komoot").

{{< strava src="7828007083" >}}

### from WHO to Bebenhausen 

Probably the easiest hike of all, it is almost mandatory if you are living in WHO. Once you reach Bebenhausen, you'll be able to visit the [Bebenhausen Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebenhausen_Abbey). Even if coming back means going uphill, this remains a quite easy and short hike.

Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/527550832?share_token=a9OnZWxxTzDr6C82b4rHYyo8SHqbPO8BFqCXmcqk2hvUaYl6Ko&ref=wtd "Komoot").
