During my stay in Tübingen (Germany), hiking was one of my favourite activities and I have to admitt the surrounding area was perfect for that.

Therefore, I created a collection of all the hikes I did and I also selected some of the best ones, which will be immediately presented as Top Hikes. 

Every hike will be presented through the [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4403103), which often also include some pictures, but a link to the [Komoot activity](https://www.komoot.it/user/2218098976141) will also be included, since it allows you to download the GPS file, which can be used to replicate the hike.

This blog post is part of a Tübingen themed project made of three posts, so you may want to also visit the Tübingen Survival Guide for International Students (coming soon!) and the [Tübingen Photo Collection](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/tuebingen_collection/).

Enjoy!

### Top Hike: around Burg Hohenzollern

This hike takes you from the train station of Bisingen, up to the [Burg Hohenzollern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenzollern_Castle) (which you can visit), then up to the Zoller Horn hill (from where you can have an amazing view of the castle) and back to Bisingen. Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/786302697?share_token=aIEibxQFqoDbQcsaw74Wk6kw6OTKPCOEekPQjOA2OI0RasYQUl&ref=wtd "Komoot").

### Top Hike: Schwarzwald Genießerpfad from Calw

This is probably the easiest way to have a little taste of the Black Forest, starting in [Calw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calw) and following a loop tour that includes the [city scaffold](https://www.komoot.it/highlight/78321) where some death sentences were carried out and some cute passages. Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/907533563?share_token=aPZ37hKQhJb93wUI5GwuX1py3qfST4PmbrLfjE3LZWS54tnTxS&ref=wtd "Komoot").

### Top Hike: around Teckberg

This hike was surprisingly good. Firstly, you go up to Teckberg, where there is a little [Burg](https://goo.gl/maps/AtUbzGXJYD7HTh2a8), then you visit some [ruins](https://goo.gl/maps/PtLoEGiH7LZYQbby9) and finally an elevated walkway on a [piece of land full of snakes and frogs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schopflocher_Torfmoor). Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/770772712?share_token=abQV14KuwJkTJnx6YCgSLVCpP3pyuaB3d6GEk7riH8aQcMxaYx&ref=wtd "Komoot").

### Top Hike: around Bad Urach

[Bad Urach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Urach) is one of best destinations for hiking. There you will be amazed by the [waterfalls](https://goo.gl/maps/5CR8cAZo2D9mj3pB8) and you will visit the [Hohenurach ruins](https://goo.gl/maps/5QQ8h8QjRiFmhpoe6). Here it is the [Koomot activity](https://www.komoot.it/tour/778869387?share_token=as67jEU9G7Pu2XXJMvR5IR45X3MgjpyD9W2T4ZvW6rVJZN4Uqh&ref=wtd "Komoot").
