Below you can find the full document version of my Master Thesis, written at the **Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen** and at the **University of Pavia** and submitted for the first time during **February 2023**. 

The research question investigates which characteristic out of **reputation**, **popularity** and **developer's brand**, reflected in some elements in the **presentation page** on **app stores**, is the most effective in predicting **user's choice to download an app**.

This same thesis is also available as a [blog post](https://lucabontempi.com/blog/determinants_of_download_on_mobile_app_stores/ "Determinants of Download on Mobile App Stores - An Empirical Analysis").
